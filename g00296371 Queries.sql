-- Basic SELECT statement. Proves Codds Rule 1 - Information Rule - Everything is stored in table format 
-- 1) Querying the animals table
SELECT name, breed
FROM animals 
ORDER BY owner_id ASC;

-- 2) Getting first name, address line 1 and the city 
-- from addresses where counties are not Galway or Sligo
SELECT first_name, address_1, city FROM addresses
WHERE county 
NOT IN ('Galway', 'Sligo');

-- 3) Get all active vets
SELECT full_name AS 'Name', email AS 'Email' FROM staff
WHERE role = 'vet'
AND is_active = 1
ORDER BY full_name DESC;

-- Basic INSERT statement, Proves Codds Rule 5 - Comprehensive Data Sub-Language Rule. Language supports Data definition and data manipulation. 
-- 4) An example of data manipulation is shown
-- Inserting an address.
INSERT INTO `addresses` (`first_name`, `last_name`, `address_1`, `address_2`, `city`, `county`, `country`, `eircode`) 
VALUES ('SQL', 'Master', 'Main Street', 'Column Avenue', 'Datbase Road', 'Schema', 'Ireland', 'xxxx 0987');

-- 5) Adding an appointment
INSERT INTO appointments (dateTime, isCancelled, animalName, withVet, reasonForAppointment, animalID, ownerName, isPaid, followUp, paymentID, createdAt)
VALUES ('2023-05-09 11:55:00', '0', 'Abigail', '7', 'Call out. Not lambing.', '4', 'Kenneth F', '0', '0', '', NOW());

-- UPDATE statement. Proves Codds Rule 6 - View Updating Rule. Updating view updates the tables contents. 
-- 6) Update the appointments table to change the status of the gig
UPDATE appointments
SET is_cancelled = 0
WHERE id = 1;

-- 7) Access the view. See how the contents differ to selecting all from the appointments table
SELECT * FROM appointments;

SELECT * FROM open_appointments_today;

-- 8) Update the view to cancel an appointment.
UPDATE open_appointments_today 
SET is_cancelled = 1
WHERE id = 1;

-- 9) Update the email address of an owner
UPDATE owners
SET email = 'ken.feeks@email.com'
WHERE id = 2;

-- ALTER statement, Codds Rule 5 - DDL query example
-- 10) Added a potentially useful column to the animals table after it was created. Using slightly different formatting that is also an accepted query in my DB
ALTER TABLE `ddd_project_vet`.`animals` 
ADD COLUMN `age` INT NULL AFTER `breed`;

-- DELETE, Codds Rule 9 - Logical Data - Altering the tables does not affect performance
-- 11) Delete a column using name as reference will cause an error. Safe update mode requires Key column to be used.
DELETE FROM treatment_guide
WHERE name = 'call out';

-- 12) Delete using the id value will work instead
DELETE FROM treatment_guide
WHERE id = 4;

-- 13) Dropping a column doesn't affect the table or the database.
ALTER TABLE `ddd_project_vet`.`animals` 
DROP COLUMN `age`;
